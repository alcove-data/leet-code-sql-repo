## 🧠 Key Learning Areas

- **Query Fundamentals** — `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `DISTINCT`, `ORDER BY`, and filtering logic  
- **Joins & Relationships** — `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `CROSS JOIN`  
- **Aggregation & Grouping** — `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, etc.)  
- **Subqueries & Nested Logic** — correlated subqueries, `IN`, `EXISTS`, derived tables  
- **Conditional Logic** — `CASE WHEN`, `IFNULL`, and data-cleaning techniques  
- **Set Operations** — `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, and deduplication  
- **Window Functions** — `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, and `OVER()` clauses  
- **CTEs & Readability** — structuring complex queries with `WITH` clauses for clarity
